# spare - Single Page Application Release Easily
Work in progress: Please do not use the code from this repository.

The 'spare' command makes easily the release of Single Page Applications. Spare constructs the infrastructure on AWS to operate the SPA, and then deploys the SPA (please note that it does not support building the SPA). Developers can inspect the infrastructure as CloudFormation before or after its construction.

The development of the 'spare' command stemmed from the desire to empower frontend engineers to deploy SPAs without relying on the skills of backend engineers, thus enhancing productivity. Additionally, the aim was to reduce the effort for backend engineers in repeatedly setting up common infrastructures. Therefore, the goal is for developers to use the 'spare' command rather than writing CloudFormation scripts.

The 'spare' command constructs the infrastructure according to the configuration file .spare.yml. To facilitate easy editing of this configuration file, we have provided the 'edit' subcommand.

## Support OS & golang version
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- golang 1.21 or later


## How to install
### Use "go install"
If you does not have the golang development environment installed on your system, please install golang from [the golang official website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## How to use
### init subcommand
init subcommand create the configuration file .spare.yml in the current directory. If you want to change the configuration file name, please use the edit subcommand.

Below is the .spare.yml file created by the 'init' subcommand. As it's currently under development, the parameters will continue to change.
```.spare.yml
spareTemplateVersion: 0.0.1
deployTarget: src
region: us-east-1
customDomain: ""
s3BucketName: ""
allowOrigins: []
```

### [WIP] edit subcommand
The 'edit' subcommand opens the .spare.yml file in the terminal. It displays explanations for each parameter, allowing users to set values without confusion. Additionally, after setting values for parameters, it performs validation to prevent saving the configuration file with incorrect settings.

### [WIP] build subcommand
The 'build' subcommand constructs the AWS infrastructure. As development progresses, the diagram of the infrastructure configuration to be built will be provided below.

### [WIP] deploy subcommand
The 'deploy' subcommand uploads the built artifacts to the S3 bucket or ECR repository. It also clears the CloudFront cache.

### [WIP] delete subcommand
The 'delete' subcommand deletes the AWS infrastructure and the SPA.

### [WIP] cloudformation subcommand
The 'cloudformation' subcommand outputs the CloudFormation template of the AWS infrastructure to be built by the 'create' subcommand.

### [WIP] validate subcommand
The 'validate' subcommand validates the contents of the .spare.yml configuration file.

## Special Thanks
![localstack](./docs/images/localstack-readme-banner.svg)
[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/) is a service that mocks AWS, covering a wide range of AWS services. It is not easy to set up an AWS infrastructure for personal development, but LocalStack has lowered the barrier for server application development.   

It has been incredibly helpful for my technical learning, and among the open-source software (OSS) I encountered in 2023, LocalStack is undoubtedly the best tool. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
