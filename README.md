# spare - Single Page Application Release Easily
The 'spare' command makes easily the release of Single Page Applications. Spare constructs the infrastructure on AWS to operate the SPA, and then deploys the SPA (please note that it does not support building the SPA). Developers can inspect the infrastructure as CloudFormation before or after its construction.

The infrastructure for S3 and CloudFront is configured as shown in the diagram when you run the "spare build" command.  

![diagram](./docs/images/s3_cloudfront.png)


When you run "spare deploy," it uploads the SPA (Single Page Application) from the specified directory to S3. The diagram below represents a sample SPA delivered by CloudFront. Please note that the "spare" command does not perform TypeScript compilation or any other build steps. It only handles the deployment of your files to S3.

## How to develop
To develop the spare command, you will need an AWS account or the Pro version of localstack, which costs $35 USD per month as of September 2023.The configuration for localstack is specified in the compose.yml file. You can start localstack using the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

If you choose to use localstack, please add the following information to your ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials files. The region can be set to any value you prefer.
```
$ cat ~/.aws/config 
[profile localstack]
region = ap-northeast-1
output = json

$ cat ~/.aws/credentials 
[localstack]
aws_access_key_id = dummy
aws_secret_access_key = dummy
```

The spare command uses the value of the AWS_PROFILE environment variable. If you are using localstack for debugging, you can set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable as follows:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=localstack
export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

The spare command has a --debug option for its subcommands that access the infrastructure, and when --debug is enabled, it accesses localstack.

## Special Thanks
![localstack](./docs/images/localstack-readme-banner.svg)
[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/) is a service that mocks AWS, covering a wide range of AWS services. It is not easy to set up an AWS infrastructure for personal development, but LocalStack has lowered the barrier for server application development.   

It has been incredibly helpful for my technical learning, and among the open-source software (OSS) I encountered in 2023, LocalStack is undoubtedly the best tool. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
